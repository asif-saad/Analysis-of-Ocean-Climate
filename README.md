| Salinity | pss | The Practical Salinity Scale (PSS) was introduced to establish a univocal relationship between salinity and conductivity. This relationship is based on the ratio R of the seawater conductivity and the conductivity C(35,15) of a standard solution of 1 kg containing 32.4356 g KCl at 15oC, which has salinity S=35 |
| sigma_theta |kg m-3 | Sigma-theta, is the density calculated with in situ salinity, potential temperature, and pressure = 0, minus 1000 kg/m3 |
| oxygen | µmol kg-1 | 
| oxygen saturation | percentage |
| nitrate | µmol kg-1 |
| chl_a | mg m-3 | Amounts of the chlorophyll-a varied from 3.8 to 0.1 mg m-3 with the maximal levels at 15 m depth. The formation and destruction of seasonal thermocline affect the chlorophyll-a concentrations. Chlorophyll-a concentration sharply decreased with depth and reached around 0.1 mg m-3 near bottom. |
