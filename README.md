| column | unit | Description |
|--------|------|----|
| Salinity | pss | The Practical Salinity Scale (PSS) was introduced to establish a univocal relationship between salinity and conductivity. This relationship is based on the ratio R of the seawater conductivity and the conductivity C(35,15) of a standard solution of 1 kg containing 32.4356 g KCl at 15oC, which has salinity S=35 |
| sigma_theta |kg m-3 | Sigma-theta, is the density calculated with in situ salinity, potential temperature, and pressure = 0, minus 1000 kg/m3 |
| oxygen | µmol kg-1 | 
| oxygen saturation | percentage |
| nitrate | µmol kg-1 |
| chl_a | mg m-3 | Amounts of the chlorophyll-a varied from 3.8 to 0.1 mg m-3 with the maximal levels at 15 m depth. The formation and destruction of seasonal thermocline affect the chlorophyll-a concentrations. Chlorophyll-a concentration sharply decreased with depth and reached around 0.1 mg m-3 near bottom. |
| b_bp700 | m-1 |
| POC | mmol m-3 | not found, still working |
| pH_insitu | Total |
| TALK | µmol kg-1 | The Total alkalinity (TAlk) of water is a measurement to assess a water sample's ability to neutralize acid. The alkalinity in natural water is mostly caused by weak acid salts, especially HCO3 which is the main form of alkalinity. Other organic acids (e.g. humic acid) which are harder to decompose, would also form salts to increase alkalinity of the water.|
| PCO2 | µatm | Located at the sea surface, the pCO2 sensor measures the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in ocean. The distribution of pCO2 is dependent on: <br> 1. increases due to gas exchange with the atmosphere at the ocean surface, <br> 2. removal by photosynthesis, <br> 3. removal by calcium carbonate formation, <br> 4. removal by solar heating, <br> 5. increases from breakdown of plant material by microbial processes, and <br> 6. addition due to dissolution of calcium carbonate. |
| DIC | µmol kg-1 | Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) [ DIC in µmol kg −1 ] is present in all natural waters. The concentration of DIC varies from less than 20 μM in acidic soft waters to more than 5000 μM in highly alkaline hard waters, but ranges between 100 and 1000 μM in most systems. DIC is usually the most abundant form of C in water. DIC consists of three main constituents: free CO2 (a gas), the bicarbonate ion (HCO3−), and the carbonate ion (CO32 −). Bicarbonate and carbonate constitute the major buffers in most natural waters and account for most of the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC; also called alkalinity). Free CO2 is the most dynamic of the constituents of DIC and is the dominant acid in most natural waters. The ratio of CO2 to HCO3− and CO32 − is the major control of pH in most natural waters. Although CO2, like other gases, readily exchanges with the atmosphere, even the surface waters of most inland systems are far from equilibrium and are usually supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere. A number of factors cause this disequilibrium. |
